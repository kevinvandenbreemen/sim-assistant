# sim-assistant
An app for helping people who enjoy Star Trek / Other simming to listen to posts in the game while driving or doing chores.

as well as to have some fun.

# Dev Setup
Before working on this project you will need to have Flutter installed.  Once Flutter is installed on your machine go to the flutter_module dir of this project and run

```
flutter packages get
```

to load the dependencies.  Once that is done do the gradle build on your machine.
